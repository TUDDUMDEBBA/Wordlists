<h1> What are brute-force and dictionary attacks? </h1>

<h4>“An attack in which cybercriminals utilize trial-and-error tactics to decode passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), and other forms of login data by leveraging automated software to test large quantities of possible combinations.” <h4>

<h1> Dictionary attack definition: <h1>

<h4> 					“A type of brute force attack where an intruder attempts to crack a password-protected security system with a “dictionary list” of common words and phrases used by businesses and individuals.” </h4>

<h4> 					 Both are common types of cybersecurity attacks in which an attacker tries to log in to a user’s account by systematically checking and attempting all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. These brute-force and dictionary attacks are common, due to large quantities of individuals reusing common password variations.</h4>

<h4>					 After all, the easiest way to attack a system is through the front door, and there must be some way to log in. If you have credentials, you can log in as a normal user would, likely without generating suspicious log entries, tripping IDS signatures, or needing an unpatched vulnerability. If you have the credentials for the system administrator, life is even easier. Attackers have neither of these luxuries; here’s an overview of how they utilize brute-force and dictionary attacks to gain access.</h4>
